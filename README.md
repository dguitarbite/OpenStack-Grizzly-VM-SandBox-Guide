* A short Decription:
 
  * [VMware] (https://www.vmware.com/) is one of the virtualization softwares which will provide a simple UI for the same. Its closed source and you will have to buy it. It is a bit more user-friendly than Virtual Box but it comes with a cost. 
   
  * [Virtual Box] (https://www.virtualbox.org/) is OpenSource virtualization software which is a bit noob-proof and agrees more with Geeks. But it supports more options and provides an API for managing, controlling Virtual Machines and other related settings.



* For those who want to use `Virtual Box` for `OpenStack Sandboxing`, can check out the following link(v0.4 - Ready to be Used. Happy Stacking):
  * [OpenStack-Grizzly-VM-SandBoxing-Guide with Virtual Box](https://github.com/dguitarbite/OpenStack-Grizzly-VM-SandBox-Guide/blob/master/SandBox-Single-Flat.rst)


* For Advanced Users who know all about virtualization - or do not want to use Virtual Machines for OpenStack deployment should check out:
  * [OpenStack-Grizzly-Install-Guide](https://github.com/mseknibilel/OpenStack-Grizzly-Install-Guide) by [Bilel Msekni] (https://github.com/mseknibilel)


Happy Stacking!!!

**Note :** If you are looking forward to learn Virtualization or OpenStack this is not a good place for you to start with.
